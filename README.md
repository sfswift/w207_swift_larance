## Note to Jason

Hi Jason! Welcome to our final project folder. We've included all of our data, project notebooks, and reference notebooks as folders. They mirror what we've been using in our github repository. Here's a brief overview to help you get your bearings.

### Data Folder

The primary folder to review is the "final" folder that contains all of our clean/processed data. These are the files you'll see read into the classifier notebooks. The "subsetted" folder has some earlier revisions of the processed data.

### Project Notebooks

Here's the bulk of the project code. In this folder there are two primary types of notebooks.

1. EDA and Preprocessing: You'll see NaN analysis, EDA review, and probably most importantly, the "Preprocessing Clean" notebook where we executed our final cleaning of the data. There were several iterations of the preprocessing.

2. Classifier Notebooks: You'll see each notebook named after the classifier we fit within the file. Please note that the neural network was not selected to include in the presentation because we didn't get very far in it. Each notebook contains the necessary packages, data exports, and where applicable, performance metrics and optimization towards the second half of the notebook.

If you have any questions regardingn loading or running the datasets, please don't hesitate to contact us via slack at dlarance and sswift.

Thanks for the semester!
